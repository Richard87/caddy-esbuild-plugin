# Caddy Esbuild plugin

This plugins watches and builds the source files continiusly. It includes a etag to cache in the browser to save bandwidth.

## TODO:
- Handle esbuild configuration
- Possibility to use FileLoader instead of only DataURL
- better Caddyfile configuration

It works right now in my ReactApp example, its also the only one I have tested so far :)
