# Caddy Esbuild plugin

This plugins watches and builds the source files continiusly. It includes a etag to cache in the browser to save bandwidth.

## TODO:
- Better esbuild/Caddyfile configuration
- Possibility to use FileLoader instead of only DataURL
- include env support
- include sass support (go-libsass)
- Hot reloading?! :O 

It works right now in my ReactApp example, its also the only one I have tested so far :)
